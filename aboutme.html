<h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
<h2><b><center>Me and My Art</center></b></h2>
<h3>I am a Digital Media Art student at San Jose State University, but I'm originally from the Sacramento area of California.  My work consists mainly of photography and digital art since that's what I'm extremely passionate about, but I also enjoy working with fine art mediums, such charcoal drawing, pencil drawing, and watercolor painting.<div>Some of these passions have opened various doors for me, as I've had the opportunity to intern for a local art gallery and to have some of my works featured in a nationally-renowned art magazine which I helped with for about two years.
</h3>
<h2><b><center>My Artistic Goals</center></b></h2>
<h3>
I plan to continue working with art throughout college and do things with it, such as venturing into portrait work or event photography; and incorporating some of my artistic styles with web design, so I can potentially help people with designing websites for various things.<div> After I graduate, I hope to find a job where I can utilize some of my artistic skills and passions when it comes to my work.
